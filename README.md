# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in a MongoDB aggregation pipeline involving `$lookup`, `$unwind`, and `$match`. The pipeline unexpectedly fails when the field 'results.someField' is missing (null) in some documents.

## Bug Description

The aggregation pipeline is designed to join data from two collections (`collectionA` and `collectionB`), unwind the results, and then filter based on a condition in the joined data. However, if the `results.someField` field is missing in certain documents after the `$unwind` stage, the pipeline throws an error and stops processing.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Set up a MongoDB database with two collections, `collectionA` and `collectionB`, similar to the example in `bug.js`.
2. Execute the aggregation pipeline in `bug.js`.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior and error.

## Solution

The solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, addresses the issue by using `$ifNull` operator to handle cases where `results.someField` is null. This ensures that documents with missing field won't cause a pipeline failure.
